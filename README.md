# cp1404practicals

This repository contains the practical activities for each week of the subject CP1404 at James Cook University.

## About Me

My name is Matthew Price, and I am a first year IT student studying at James Cook University in Townsville, QLD.

The three main lessons I have learned about "clean code" in the subject so far are:

- (SRP) better known as Single Responsibility Principle
- If code is repeated, perhaps it can be made into a function
- Follow PEP8 conventions
