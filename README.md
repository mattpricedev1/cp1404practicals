## About

This repo contains the practical activities for each week of CP1404
My name is Matthew Price, and I'm a year 1 IT student studying at JCU in Townsville.

The three main lessons I have learned about "clean code" in this subject are:

- (SRP) better known as Single Responsibility Principle
- If code is repeated, perhaps it can be made into a function
- Follow PEP8 conventions
